Riot Games has been teasing us with their upcoming fighting game, codenamed "Project L," for years. However, it seems that the wait is finally over as the game's real name has been revealed: 2XKO.

For those unfamiliar with the game, 2XKO is a tag-team style fighting game set in the world of Runeterra, the same universe as Riot Games' popular MOBA game, League of Legends. Players will build a team of two different champions, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. The game has a focus on fast-paced action and strategic gameplay.

We can't help but wonder what other surprises Riot Games has in store for us. With their track record of creating engaging and gigantic games like League of Legends and VALORANT, we have no doubt that 2XKO will be a hit among both casual and competitive fighting game players.
