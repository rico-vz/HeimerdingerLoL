### Understanding League of Legends Summoner Name Changes

Changing your name in League of Legends is super simple, but it's important to know some details about it first! It used to be that you would change just your summoner name in League of Legends, no other games, and it’d cost 1300RP or 13900BE. Since November 20th, 2023 League of Legends has migrated to Riot Games their “Riot ID” system over the old Summoner Names system. You can read more about that here: [Summoner Name to Riot ID Transition FAQ.](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/20616577122707-Summoner-Name-to-Riot-ID-Transition-FAQ)

So what does this change mean for you?

### Differences between Riot ID and Summoner Name

There are a few key differences between the old, now deprecated, Summoner Name system and the Riot ID system:

Summoner Names were the unique names used for players in League of Legends. This name was visible to all other players and could be changed for a 1300 RP (around €10) or 13900 Blue Essence. In contrast, Riot ID is a unique identifier that consists of a display name and an alphanumeric tag and is free to change. Summoner Names could be changed as much as you’d like as long as you had enough Riot Points or Blue Essence, your Riot ID can only be changed once every 90 days.

Also, a Riot ID is tied to a player's entire account, not just a specific game or region. This means players can use the same Riot ID across multiple Riot Games, like League of Legends, Valorant and 2XKO. Summoner Names were specific to each League of Legends region. With summoner names, only a single player on EUW could have the name “[Heimerdinger](https://heimerdinger.lol/)”. Because Riot IDs have a tag (“Heimerdinger#tag01”) and the tag does not show in-game, more people can have the name “Heimerdinger” in-game! This is great if you just want to use your regular name without having to worry about it being taken or having to add random letters, as your tag isn’t really shown in-game.

Overall, the shift from Summoner Names to Riot ID represents Riot Games' effort to modernize and provide a more unified experience across all their games.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Changing Your Riot ID

Changing your Riot ID in League of Legends is pretty easy, and you can do it in a few simple steps.

Log into your League of Legends account on the [official website](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/). Once logged in, hover over your name in the top-right corner and select “Settings”. Navigate to the "Account" section and look for the "Riot ID" option. Click on it to begin the name change process. You will see your current Riot ID in the text fields, a game name and a tagline. The combination of those 2 is your Riot ID and must be unique. Simply click on the text field you’d like to change and enter the name you would like to be your new Riot ID.

Make sure it meets Riot's guidelines in terms of length and appropriateness. Once you've entered your new ID, check it carefully for typos just in-case, as you’ll be locked out of changing it again for 90 days once you go through with it.

Next, just click the “Save Changes” button. If your Riot ID is available, it’ll save and now your name is changed!

Keep in mind that name changes may take some time to show in all games, so be patient and consider restarting your client if it didn’t change for you yet.

That's all there is to it! By following these simple steps, you can easily change your Riot ID and freshen up your League of Legends identity.

### Considerations Before Changing Your League of Legends Name

When changing your League of Legends name (or Riot ID), there are a few things you should keep in mind. Firstly, Riot has a strict 90-day cooldown policy on name changes, so you'll need to wait at least three months before you can change it again if you decide you don’t like it.

It’s also important to be aware that your Riot ID, which is the unique name associated with your account, will be displayed across all Riot their games that you play. This means that even if you change your in-game name for League, your Riot ID will also show in Valorant, 2XKO or Legends of Runeterra.

The League of Legends name change policy is designed to prevent abuse. Therefore, there are certain words and phrases which are banned. Changing your name to something crass will probably not work, and if you decide to try and bypass their filter, you might be forced to name change or get a 14-day ban. So just choose a normal name you like.

Before changing your name / Riot ID, make sure you're certain that this is the one you want to use and that it has no typos, as you'll be stuck with it for at least 90 days.

If your account was stolen and the person that stole it changed your Riot ID, don’t worry! It’s likely that Riot Support can help you out and revert the name change without waiting 90 days, [just send them a ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)

### Unique and Creative Name Ideas for Your League of Legends Account

Choosing a unique and creative name for your League of Legends account can be a fun and expressive. Whether you're looking for a clever pun, something funny, or a name that reflects your play style and/or main champion, there are endless possibilities to make your summoner name stand out.

Some tips for coming up with great League of Legends name ideas include playing with word combinations, using some gaming references, or using your own name in a creative way. You can also draw inspiration from your favorite champions, abilities, or lore elements within the game.

Something to keep in mind now that we have the Riot ID system, is that the name will be shown across all Riot their games. So if you decide to name yourself Heimerdinger, it will also be your name when you’re tapping heads in VALORANT as Jett.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues with League of Legends Name Changes

Having trouble changing your League of Legends name? You're not alone. We'll cover some of the most common League of Legends name change problems and provide troubleshooting steps to help you get your new name set up smoothly.

One of the most frequent problems is receiving an error that your desired name is already taken. This can happen if the exact name you want is currently in use by another player. To work around this, try changing your tag to something else, “[Heimerdinger](https://heimerdinger.lol/)#0001” might be taken, but you could also try “Heimerdinger#1234”. Your tag is mostly used just to add each other as friends, so don’t worry about it too much.

Another common issue is the name change not going through at all. This may be due to a technical issue or server-side problem. If you encounter this, reach out to the League of Legends support team for assistance. They can investigate the issue and guide you through a successful name update.

Regardless of the specific problem you have, if it doesn’t resolve itself, and you can’t find any information about it, try just reaching out to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us). They’ll be happy to help you with your League of Legends name change.
