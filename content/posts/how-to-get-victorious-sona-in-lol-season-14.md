### How to Get Victorious Sona

Previously you needed to reach Gold or higher in Ranked to get the Victorious skin, but now you need to earn enough split points in Ranked. The exact amount of split points you will need depends on your rank, if you're in Iron, Bronze or sIlver you will need to earn 1000 total split points to unlock the Victorious Sona skin. If you're in Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster or Challenger you will only need to earn 80 total split points to unlock the Victorious Sona skin. 
Once you have earned enough split points, you will get the Victorious Sona skin for free as long as you're Honor Level 2 or above.

### Time is Ticking

Season 14 Split 2 ends on September 24th, 2024. Make sure you have enough split points to unlock the Victorious Sona skin before the season ends. If you don't have enough split points by then, you will miss out on this skin.

If you're interested in getting a rank chroma for the Victorious Sona skin, you will need to reach the rank in question as your final rank for the season. For example, if you want the Diamond chroma, you will need to end the season in Diamond rank. If you reach Diamond you will also get the Iron to Emerald chromas.

### Who Made the Victorious Sona Skin?

While we aren't sure who made the in-game model and effects for the Victorious Sona skin, we do know that the splash art was created by [Pandart](https://www.artstation.com/pandart-studio). Pandart has created many splash arts for League of Legends and Valorant, and their work is always stunning. The Victorious Sona splash art is no exception. 
We also know that the voice actor for Victorious Sona is Canadian voice actress [Erin Fitzgerald](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0280230/), who has voiced many characters in video games and animated series over the years. Such as Janna, May Kanker and Nazz from Ed, Edd n Eddy, and many more.

### Previous Victorious Skins

Sona joins a lineup of champions that have received the Victorious skin in the past. Some of the previous Victorious skins include:

- [Victorious Morgana](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/victorious-morgana)

And many more! Each Season split, Riot selects a champion to receive the Victorious skin. This skin is awarded to players who have earned enough split points in Ranked. The Victorious skin is a great way to show off your skill and dedication to the game, and just a cool little reward for playing Ranked.

### Grind for the Victorious Sona Skin

With the new split point system, instead of the Gold rank requirement, it's easier than ever to get the Victorious Sona skin. All you need to do is play Ranked and earn enough split points to unlock the skin. Make sure you have enough split points before the season ends on September 24th, 2024, so you don't miss out on this enchanting skin.

So, queue up for Ranked, keep an eye on those Split Points, and let's hit the Rift. Victorious Sona is waiting for you, and the clock is ticking until September 24th! Good luck, and have fun! üéâ
