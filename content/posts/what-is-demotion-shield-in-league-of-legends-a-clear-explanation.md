If you're a League of Legends player, you may have heard of the term "demotion shield" before. Or perhaps you are seeing it on your profile right now. But what exactly is the demotion shield in League of Legends, and how does it work? In short, the demotion shield is a feature that prevents players from dropping down a tier if they lose some games after being promoted.

When you're promoted into a new tier, you'll gain a demotion shield effect. This effect will last for a certain period of time or until you lose a certain number of games, depending on the circumstances. The demotion shield is designed to prevent players from immediately dropping down a tier due to some unlucky games, giving them a chance to prove themselves and maintain their new rank.

However, it's important to note that the demotion shield is not a permanent feature. If you continue to lose games while under the demotion shield effect, you will eventually lose the shield and be at risk of demoting. 

## Overview of Demotion Shield
If you're a League of Legends player, you might know the term "Demotion Shield", but you might not know exactly what it is or how it works. In this section, we'll tell you what exactly Demotion Shield is and how it works.

### Purpose of Demotion Shield
The purpose of the Demotion Shield is to prevent players in ranked from dropping down a tier immediately after they get promoted. Essentially, it gives players a slight "safe" period to get used to the new rank and not get demoted because their jungler decided to play Janna jungle üå™Ô∏èüå≤. 

### How Demotion Shield Works
When you get promoted into a new tier for the first time, you will receive a Demotion Shield. The shield is a temporary effect that prevents you from immediately dropping down a tier if you lose some games at 0LP. The number of games that the Demotion Shield lasts for depends on the tier or division you're in.

The Demotion Shield usually lasts between 3 to 10 games after advancing a tier, up through Diamond. However, for Masters the Demotion Shield only lasts for your first 3 games in the tier.

Keep in mind that the Demotion Shield applies to losses that would normally get you demoted. So if you lose games while your Demotion Shield is still active, you will still lose LP and MMR. But you won't be demoted until the Demotion Shield expires and you keep losing games.

## Getting a Demotion Shield
In League of Legends, the Demotion Shield is a feature that prevents players from being demoted to a lower tier being promoted to a new tier for the first time.

### First Time in a New Tier
When you win enough games and get enough LP, you will be promoted to a higher tier. If it's your first time being promoted to that tier you will earn the Demotion Shield. This will protect you from being demoted for a short time.

## Losing the Demotion Shield
If you start losing games while you have the Demotion Shield active, you might get an icon and message saying "Demotion Shield Expiring." This means that you're getting close to losing the Demotion Shield, and you should try to make sure you stop losing games at low LP. Because once your shield expires, you will be at risk of being demoted if you lose another game.

### Shield Expiration
The Demotion Shield has a limited duration, and it will expire after a certain amount of games played. The exact amount of games in the tiers Diamond and below isn't stated by Riot Games in their [article about demotions and decay](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405783687443-Placements-Promotions-Series-Demotions-and-Decay#demotions-and-decay-0-2) anymore, but our guess is that it's currently between 3 to 10 games. For Masters we do know the exact amount of games, that being 3 games after you got promoted to Masters for the first time.

### Avoid losing your Demotion Shield
The Demotion Shield is based on your performance after promoting, and it will be removed if you aren't playing well. 

To avoid losing your Demotion Shield, you should focus on staying calm, playing well and winning games. Try to avoid big losing streaks, and take a break if you are getting tilted or tired. If you do lose your shield, don't panic. Even if you demote, you can still get back to the rank by winning games just like you did before.

In summary, the Demotion Shield is a protective measure that prevents you from being demoted after a loss. However, it has a limited duration and will expire after a certain number of games. To avoid losing your shield, you should focus on playing well and winning games.

## Impact on Player Experience
The Demotion Shield mechanic in League of Legends has a significant impact on the player experience. As it helps to reduce ranked anxiety and encourages people to play ranked.

### Reducing Ranked Anxiety
Ranked anxiety is a real emotion that people get that can negatively impact their in-game performance. Being scared of losing a game and being demoted can cause players to play more cautiously, leading to mistakes or missed opportunities. The Demotion Shield helps reduce this anxiety for people by providing a temporary safety net for players who just promoted to a new tier.

When a player has a Demotion Shield, they might play more focused and take more calculated risks without the fear of losing their rank. This can lead to a more fun gaming experience and a better performance in-game.

### Encouraging Playing Ranked
The Demotion Shield also encourages players to keep playing more ranked. When a player just gets promoted to a new tier and is at risk of being demoted, they may be more likely to stop playing ranked altogether. The Demotion Shield provides an incentive for them to continue playing ranked.

Overall, the Demotion Shield mechanic has a positive impact on the player experience in League of Legends. It helps to reduce ranked anxiety and encourages people to play ranked games, which can lead to a more enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone.

## Finding Your Demotion Shield Status
If you're wondering whether your demotion shield is active or not, there is a way to check and make sure.

### Client Profile Indicator
The easiest way to check your demotion shield status is to look at the "Profile" tab in your League Client. To do this, click the "Profile" tab that is indicated by a little avatar icon and look for yellow or red warning icons next to your rank.

A yellow warning icons means that the demotion shield is expiring somewhat soon, while a red icon means it's pretty much gone. If you still lose at this point, you'll be demoted to the previous tier.
