## Requirements for Unlocking Hatty Crabby Icon

To unlock the Hatty Crabby Icon in League of Legends, there are some requirements. Luckily they aren't anything crazy so you're probably already good to go!

#### Minimum Account Level (It's Level 3)

There is a minimum account level requirement, but not really. The Hatty Crabby Icon can only be unlocked from playing Quickplay games. [Quickplay games open up at level 3](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751894-Unlocking-Game-Modes). So unless you just made your League of Legends account, you are good to go! If you did just create your account, finishing the 3 tutorial stages will give you enough EXP to get to level 3.

#### Time-gated Event

Unfortunately the "Insert Cute Name Here: Befriend Little Legends on Summoner's Rift" mission is only here for a limited time, so you have to be quick! The mission will be available from April 1st 2024 until April 3rd 2024.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Hatty Crabby Icon

If you're looking to get your hands on the [Hatty Crabby Icon](https://heimerdinger.lol/icon/hatty-crabby-icon-votcm) in League of Legends, you've come to the right place. If you prefer a video guide over a text guide you should check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_0Cy_W7Huo&utm_source=heimerdinger.lol&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=blog_post" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matty Love Gaming's video</a>

### Mission Goal Explained

You need to queue up for a Quickplay game, as the April Fools event is only enabled in Quickplay games.

When you're in a Quickplay match, you're going to want to find and befriend Little Legends that are hidden around the map.
Some may be located in random bushes, while others are found in the alcoves. To make it easier for them to be found, you can unlock your camera and move it around the map. Any areas where a Little Legend is will stand out, as there will be a golden glow.

So, run toward the glow spots, and when you see the Little Legend, spam-click it until it becomes your friend and starts following youa round the map.

When you kill an enemy you also get their Little Legends following you, however it doesn't seem like the Little Legends you get from killing enemies count towards the mission to unlock the Hatty Crabby Icon.
Some players have also speculated that you need to stay alive with the Little Legends for a certain amount of time for them to actually count towards the mission, but this isn't confirmed.

Even if you don't complete the mission first try you don't have to worry as there is no maximum game limit to complete the mission; you can just try again by queueing another quickplay game.
