League of Legends' latest premium skin, [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx), has arrived in The Sanctum, bringing one of the most sought-after character designs from the hit Netflix series directly into the game. But unlike traditional skin releases, getting your hands on this particular Arcane version of Jinx requires you to use a gacha system.

## The Essentials

Before diving into strategies and systems, here's what you need to know: [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx) is exclusively available through The Sanctum, a new gacha mechanic found in your Loot tab. Each attempt costs 400 RP, with a base drop rate of 0.5%. However, there is some good news - you're guaranteed to receive the skin within 80 pulls, thanks to the pity system.

This premium Jinx skin, will only be available until January 10 2025.

## Understanding the Gacha System

Let's break down exactly how The Sanctum works, because it's not your typical skin shop experience. Think of it like opening Hextech chests, but with a pity reward system if your luck is super bad.

### Where to Find The Sanctum

First things first - you'll find The Sanctum right in your League client under the Loot tab. It's got a fresh new interface that stands out from the usual store layout, and you can't miss the [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx) showcase at the center of it all.

### How The Sanctum Pull System Works

Here's the deal: each attempt to get [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx) costs 400 RP. That's quite high, but at least you're guaranteed to get the skin within 80 pulls thanks to the pity system. Let's break down those numbers:

-   Base drop rate: 0.5%
-   Cost per attempt: 400 RP
-   Maximum pulls needed: 80

Pro tip: The Sanctum keeps track of your pulls automatically, so you'll always know exactly how close you are to that guaranteed drop.

### Time-Limited Opportunity

Here's something you absolutely need to know: this isn't a permanent addition to the store. The current Sanctum rotation featuring [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx) is only sticking around until January 10 2025. Once that timer runs out, we don't know when (or if) the skin will return. Considering how past Arcane skins in games like VALORANT never came back, it's safe to assume it might not come back.

For all you Jinx mains and Arcane fans out there, this means you've got a limited window to make your decision. Whether you're planning to test your luck with a few pulls or commit to getting that guaranteed drop, you'll want to plan your RP purchases accordingly.

## Drop Rates & Probability

Let's talk about your odds of pulling [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx), and trust me - you'll want to know these numbers before diving in with your RP.

### Breaking Down Your Chances

-   Every single pull has a 0.5% chance of dropping [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx)
-   That's 1 in 200 odds for each attempt
-   After 80 pulls: You're getting that skin, guaranteed

### The Math

Let's get real about what these numbers mean for your wallet and your chances. With each 400 RP pull, you're not just throwing RP into the void - you're building toward that guaranteed drop.

Best case scenario? You get super lucky and pull [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx) on your first try (you probably wont). Worst case? You'll need all 80 pulls, but at least you know exactly what you're in for.

Here's how the probability actually breaks down:

-   First 10 pulls: About 5% chance of success
-   By pull 40: You've had roughly a 20% shot
-   At pull 79: If you haven't gotten it yet, you're 100% getting it next pull\

## Total Cost Breakdown: What You're Really Paying

Let's talk money - specifically, how much [Arcane Fractured Jinx](https://heimerdinger.lol/skin/arcane-fractured-jinx) might set you back. Whether you're planning to go all-in or just try your luck.

Here's the thing about The Sanctum's costs - it's all about that 400 RP per pull. Let's put that into perspective:

For a Guaranteed Drop (80 pulls):

-   Total RP needed: 32,000 RP
-   Real money cost: Approximately $250
