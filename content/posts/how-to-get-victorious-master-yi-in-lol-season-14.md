## Understanding Split Points in Season 14

Let's dive into exactly how you'll unlock that sweet Victorious [Master Yi](https://heimerdinger.lol/champion/master-yi) skin through League's split point system! Whether you're a ranked veteran or just starting your climb, understanding how split points work is your key to success.

### Split Point Requirements Breakdown

The path to Victorious Master Yi varies depending on your rank, and it's actually more straightforward than you might think:

**Gold and Above (80 Split Points)**

- Gold
- Platinum
- Emerald
- Diamond
- Master
- Grandmaster
- Challenger

**Below Gold (1000 Split Points)**

- Iron
- Bronze
- Silver

Think of split points as your ranked progress tracker - they're earned through every ranked game you play, win or lose! The system rewards consistent participation, meaning you don't need to be a challenger-tier player to rock this awesome [Master Yi](https://heimerdinger.lol/champion/master-yi) skin.

### How to Track Your Progress

Checking your split point progress is super easy:

- Open your League client
- Head to your Profile
- Click on "Ranked"
- Look for the Split Progress bar at the bottom

The progress bar shows exactly how close you are to unlocking Victorious Master Yi. Pro tip: Keep an eye on your current rank too - if you hit Gold, your required split points automatically drop to 80! (But if you drop under Gold it'll go to 1000 again.)

### Honor Level Requirements

Here's something crucial that many players overlook - you need to maintain Honor Level 2 or above to be eligible for Victorious Yi. This isn't just about grinding games; it's about being a positive fella :).

If your honor level is below 2, don't panic! You still have time to:

- Play consistently without negative behavior
- Earn honor from teammates
- Avoid any penalties or restrictions

Remember, your split point progress keeps accumulating even while you work on your honor level. Just make sure you hit Honor 2 before the season ends to claim your reward!
