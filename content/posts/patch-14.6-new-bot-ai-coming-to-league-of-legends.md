According to Riot Games, the primary goal of this new AI is to provide newer players with a space to learn. With the new AI, Co-op versus AI should feel more similar to an actual normal (PVP) League of Legends game.

The bots have been updated to be more similar to actual players . They now have better logic behind where they are moving, strategic decision-making, and a better understanding of gameplay mechanics. Additionally, bots can now jungle, rotate between lanes, and take map objectives. So the weird double toplane strategy will be no more.

The bots were live on PBE last September, where players were able to playtest and provide feedback on what they liked or disliked while playing. Riot Games has implemented over 80 player feedback fixes and improvements to the bots since then, including much better itemization, movement, and combat of the bots, as well as added usage of the environmental plants.

If you happen to stumble upon any unwanted bugs when going against the bots, you can submit them through any of the League channels that Riot Games currently take feedback and bugs through: LoL Bug Reporter (in the client) and Player Support.

Overall, the new and improved Bot AI system will provide players with a more realistic and challenging experience while playing Co-op versus AI.

## Gameplay Changes for Bot AI in 14.6
League of Legends is introducing new AI bots in Patch 14.6, which will bring significant changes to the gameplay experience. Here are some of the most notable changes:
### Strategic Improvements
Co-op vs AI should now feel more like an actual League of Legends game, helping new players learn the game. The bots will rotate between lanes, jungle, and take map objectives. This will provide a more realistic experience for players who want to practice and accurately show how the game is played for new players opposed to double top, or bots that would randomly stop working and sit AFK in fountain.

The bots will also use proper Runes and Summoner Spells, and actually be in their regular lanes. This will make it easier for players to learn new champions and roles, and understand the importance of strategy and positioning in the game.

### Jungling Bots are Coming
One of the most significant changes coming with the new AI bots is the addition of jungling bots. These bots will be able to effectively navigate the jungle and provide a more challenging experience for players. This is a significant improvement from the current bots, where in Co-op vs AI you would be forced into playing double toplane because the bots didn't jungle. And it will also help new players realize that double top isn't really a thing.

Jungling bots will make it easier for players to learn the jungle role, which is essential for winning games. They will also provide a more challenging experience for players who want to practice their skills against more advanced opponents.

In conclusion, the new AI bots coming to League of Legends in Patch 14.6 will bring significant improvements to the gameplay experience. With strategic improvements and the addition of jungling bots, players will have a more realistic and challenging experience when practicing and learning the game.
