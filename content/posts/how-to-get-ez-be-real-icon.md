## Introduction

Recently I noticed that a new icon got added to our [icons](https://heimerdinger.lol/icons) page - the "[Ez-be-real](https://heimerdinger.lol/icon/ez-be-real-icon-3tgiw)" icon, which is an icon that has Ezreal looking like he can't believe whatever he just saw. If you're wondering how you can get this icon, this post has everything you need to know!

## What is the Ez-be-real Icon?

As mentioned before, the Ez-be-real icon is just Ezreal looking in disbelief. It's nothing too special but I really like it, so I wanted to create this post for other people who also wondered how you can get it! Also, the icon name is a homophonic pun on "Ezreal" and "Are you being real..?" which I personally like.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Obtaining the Ez-be-real Icon

While most icons are just listed in the shop and can be bought for 250RP, this isn't one of them. You can only get it by watching LoL esports through the official website while you're logged in.
It's also possible to get it from crafting, but the chance would be extremely low. Though you could always try during the Blue Essence Emporium!

### 1. Head to LoL Esports Website

Visit <https://lolesports.com> using your preferred browser.

### 2. Account Login

Sign in with your Riot account to the website, if you're signed in you should be able to see your Riot name on the top right of the page.

### 3. Watch Live Tournaments

Look for any current live broadcasts of League tournaments such as First Stand 2025 which is happening right now. Any tournaments that is happening should work too, like the LEC or LTA.

### 4. Verify Rewards Tracking

While watching the stream, look for the "**REWARDS âœ…**" text in the bottom right corner of the page. If you see that, it means everything is working!

If you don't see this icon, try clearing your cookies or using a different browser.

### 5. Watch and Be Patient

The esports drops are generally pretty random, though they are more likely to happen after a hype play (e.g. a pentakill) or silver scrapes. So you will just have to keep watching and hope you get a drop that also happens to be the [Ez-be-real icon](https://heimerdinger.lol/icon/ez-be-real-icon-3tgiw)! It might take a while so don't give up if you don't get it after 1 day.

## Some Tips

- **Watch official broadcasts only** - sadly, only official broadcasts on the website count. You can't get it by watching co-streamers like Caedrel.
- **Keep the stream active** - minimized or muted tabs should still work, but make sure the tab isn't inactive.
- **Make sure you're logged in** - a few times I was randomly logged out from the website so just double-check from time to time!
