# üß†ü§Ø Brainstorm

My ideas for the "Heimerdinger.lol" project.

## üìù Notes

-   Heimerdinger.lol will be a website around the game "League of Legends", meant to be a resource to find information about the game and various tools related to it.
-   The website will be built using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework.
-   The website will be built using the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework.
-   The website will be getting data from the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
